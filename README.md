# PyTorch Regression and Multi-Class Classification Lab

## Objective
This lab aims to familiarize with PyTorch library for Regression and Multi-Class Classification tasks using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)/Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

## Regression

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand and visualize the dataset to gain insights.

### 2. Deep Neural Network Architecture
- Implement a DNN architecture using PyTorch for regression.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use GridSearch from sklearn to find optimal hyperparameters.

### 4. Visualization
- Plot Loss and Accuracy against Epochs for both training and test data.

### 5. Regularization
- Apply various regularization techniques and compare with the initial model.

## Multi-Class Classification

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and standardize/normalize the data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explore and visualize the dataset.

### 3. Data Augmentation
- Apply techniques to balance the dataset.

### 4. Deep Neural Network Architecture
- Design a DNN architecture using PyTorch for multi-class classification.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Utilize GridSearch to find optimal hyperparameters.

### 6. Visualization
- Plot Loss and Accuracy against Epochs for both training and test data.

### 7. Metrics Calculation
- Evaluate metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and f1 score on training and test datasets.

### 8. Regularization
- Apply various regularization techniques and compare with the initial model.
